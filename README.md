Step 2: Convert the Image
Once youâ€™re happy with the image, it needs to be saved as favicon.ico. This is the recommended format supported by most web browsers.

To convert your file to the .ico format, you may need to use an online tool such as iconifier.net, prodraw.net, or faviconer.com.

There are many available. Simply upload your image, select the icon size, and you can then download your brand new .ico file.
